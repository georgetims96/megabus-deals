## Megabus Deals

# To Do
(1) Convert purely template loading to template loading + AJAX request
(2) Customize accordion to only have one open at a time and automatically open return once an out-journey has been selected
(3) Filter out non-valid journeys (i.e those journeys that are more than a week after the selected out date)
(4) Filter only valid destination cities for a given source city
(5) Implement a caching system
(6) Add hidden "Evil" method

# Known Issues
- Some non-$1-dollar deals are appearing
- Duplicate deals appear (i.e. New York to Philadelphia/return journey(?))
