## Megabus Deals

# To Do
1. ~~Convert purely template loading to template loading + AJAX request~~
2. ~~Customize accordion to only have one open at a time and automatically open return once an out-journey has been selected~~
3. ~~Filter out non-valid journeys (i.e those journeys that are more than a week after the selected out date)~~
4. Filter only valid destination cities for a given source city
5. Implement a caching system
6. Add hidden "Evil" method
7. Add option to expand search if there are no $1 dollar deals

# Known Issues
- Some non-$1-dollar deals are appearing
- Duplicate deals appear (i.e. New York to Philadelphia/return journey(?))
- ~~Date is in UK format~~
- Don't have a "No Results Found" view

# What I've Learned
- This is my first TypeScript-only project. I learned how to set up tsconfig and tslint files to my desired specification. I also learned how to use Express in TypeScript.
